# Space Age

## [Setup Instructions](../README.md#setup)

Run the following command:

```bash
cd age
cargo test
```

Implement [convert_space_age](./src/lib.rs) method and fix the tests.

## Space Age

Calculate the space age for given earth age.

For instance, if someone is `10 years old`, it means he lived for `10 x 365 = 3650` earth days.
_3650 Earth days_ equal to `41.49` Mercury years.
Because length of year in Mercury is `87.97 Earth days`.
So he is `41 'Mercury' years old`.

> Return 0 if age less than 0.
